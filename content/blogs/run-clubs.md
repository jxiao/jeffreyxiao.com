It's been a while since I [first published this site](/blogs/hello-world) earlier this year. You probably haven't been wondering what I've been up to since moving into NYC, but I'm going to tell you anyway since this is my blog. Feel free to leave at any point. :smile:

A lot has happened in the last four and a half months - I'll list a few off the top of my head: 
- First job @ [MongoDB](https://www.mongodb.com/) (a big one! Lots of fun and lessons learned)
- Florida ([Golf](https://admiralscove.net/), [Coup](https://boardgamegeek.com/boardgame/131357/coup), and too many oysters ðŸ¤®)
- Lots of korean BBQ (trying out new restaurants with the family)

I'll write about some of my above experiences in another post -- in this one, I want to share my journey back to running and the people I've met along the way.

## What's there to do in a big city?

College is over. Not living at home in NJ anymore. Evenings and weekends are completely free now. What's a new grad supposed to do with all this time?  To put this into perspective (for my numbers geeks): there's $168$ hours in a week. Take away 40 hours for work, and assume I get $8$ hours of sleep a night.  I'm still left with $72$ hours.  That's a ton of time to kill by going to the gym, working on side projects, or whatever.  It was time to find a new hobby. A new obsession that would help me navigate post-grad life and life in the city.

- Spectated Philly half, reminded of the running community adn the energy

## The Dreadmill

- Made a deal with Vishaal, signed up for Staten Island Half together
- Strongly dislike the treadmill and running on my own, so I turned to Sammy for running club recommendations

Lost. Asked Sammy.
