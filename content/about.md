Hi! My name is Jeffrey, and I'm a recent alum of the [University of Pennsylvania](https://www.upenn.edu/) where I studied [Computer Science](https://www.cis.upenn.edu/).  Right now, I work at [MongoDB](https://www.mongodb.com/) as a member of the Atlas Clusters team.

I'm building this site while learning the Hugo framework, with plenty of design inspiration coming from [Davis Haupt](https://davi.sh/) and [Peyton Walters](https://pawa.lt/)' own personal sites.
