As the largest marathon in the world and one of the six [World Marathon Majors](https://www.worldmarathonmajors.com/six-star/majors), the TCS NYC Marathon is an unparalleled showcase of human resilience and global participation, drawing over 50,000 runners annually to the bustling streets of New York City. Earning a spot in this race is no easy task. Broadly speaking, there are a few ways to get into this race:

- **Run a qualifying time**. For most runners, [these times](https://www.nyrr.org/tcsnycmarathon/runners/marathon-time-qualifiers) will be out of reach.
- **Win the lottery**. Good luck with this one. This year, only [4% of applicants](https://www.runnersworld.com/news/a60329978/new-york-city-marathon-2024-drawing/) made it through.
- **Run with a charity**. Not as easy as it sounds. Charities have limited spots as well, not to mention raising the funds.
- **Complete 9+1 the year prior**. <-- This one!

The [9+1 NYC Marathon Program](https://www.nyrr.org/run/guaranteed-entry/tcs-new-york-city-marathon-9plus1-program) gives local runners a chance to earn guaranteed entry for the following year's NYC Marathon. Participants who run 9 NYRR-eligible races and volunteer at an event will earn a spot in the world's largest marathon.

I started my journey a bit late, but have just enough to round out my races for the year.  Here's my 9+1 for 2024:

# Races (2024)

### 1. May 18:&nbsp; [2024 RBC Brooklyn Half](https://www.nyrr.org/races/2024rbcbrooklynhalf)&emsp; (1:35:25)

First ever half in the books (thanks to [Midnight Runners](https://www.midnightrunners.com/cities/new-york) for the lottery bib)! Exited the park feeling good, on pace for sub 1:30, but had a mental explosion after realizing the last 10k was a straight-shot on the parkway to Coney Island.  Managed to get it together and collapse only after crossing the finish line and stopping my watch (a must!). Had a great time though and hungry for more. 

### 2. June 5:&nbsp; [Virtual NYRR Global Running Day 5K](https://www.nyrr.org/races/virtualnyrrglobalrunningday5k)
NYRR hosts several virtual races every year.  These races can be done on your own time, at your own pace, anywhere in the world.  This one in particular counts towards the 9+1 program - and for someone late to the game, this was an easy one to knock out.

### 3. June 15:&nbsp; [Citizens Queens 10K](https://www.nyrr.org/races/citizensqueens10k)&emsp; (39:00)

Another race in the books! To be honest, I was incredibly lucky to run this race.  I run with a club called [Endorphins](https://www.endorphinsrunning.com/), and they had a few entry spots to give away to members.  Not thinking about it, I entered into the lottery for a spot - but quickly forgot about it.  4 days before race day, I received an email saying that I had won with instructions to pick up my bib. I hadn't done any prep work, but am grateful to have had the chance to race.

The race itself was, in my opinion, a zoo. There's almost 10,000+ runners on a relatively narrow, only slightly maintained road, not to mention the 27 turns in the course.  That being said, the weather was on our side, with a slight tailwind hitting us on the last mile.  Overall: chaotic, but fun race (sub-40!).

### 4. September 8:&nbsp; [New Balance 5th Avenue Mile](https://www.nyrr.org/races/newbalance5thavenuemile)&emsp; (4:57)

Cool, sunny day to run 1609 meters straight down 5th Ave! Bumped into my old friend Jon on the way there and ran the race together. I didn't do any specific training for this race, but it was a nice break from the regular double-digit mileage runs/races. The energy is very different given the short course, but it's always exciting and fun.  Would definitely recommend giving this race a shot!

### 5. October 6:&nbsp; [NYRR Jersey City 5K](https://www.nyrr.org/races/nyrrjerseycity5k)
### 6. October 13:&nbsp; [2024 NYRR Staten Island Half](https://www.nyrr.org/races/nyrrstatenislandhalf)
### 7. November 2:&nbsp; [Abbott Dash to the Finish Line 5K](https://www.nyrr.org/races/abbottdashtothefinishline5k)
### 8. November 24:&nbsp; [Race to Deliver 4M to Benefit God's Love We Deliver](https://www.nyrr.org/races/racetodeliver4mtobenefitgodslovewedeliver)
### 9. December 7:&nbsp; [NYRR Ted Corbitt 15K](https://www.nyrr.org/races/nyrrtedcorbitt15k)
