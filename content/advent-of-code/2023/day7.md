Peek the title! 

<!-- Explain the problem -->

Since the title of this puzzle is so relevant to camels, we'll make use of some of OCaml's extensive core features like user-defined types, pattern matching, and function compositions.
<!-- 
Start by explaining the user defined types, inherent ordering of the types, etc.

Then explain how we can (without recursion) break down the result of each hand using a few if statements and clever ordering. -->
